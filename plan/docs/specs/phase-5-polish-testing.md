# Phase 5: Polish & Testing

> **Status**: Placeholder - to be detailed when Phase 4 nears completion

## Overview

Phase 5 focuses on hardening the system: comprehensive testing, documentation, and code quality improvements.

## Goals

- Comprehensive test coverage (integration, contract, load)
- Safety/red-team evaluations
- Architecture and API documentation
- Performance optimization

## Key Deliverables

1. **Testing Suite**
   - Integration tests with golden files
   - Contract tests for API DTOs
   - Load/concurrency tests
   - Safety/red-team evaluations for adversarial inputs

2. **Documentation**
   - Architecture diagrams (Mermaid)
   - Data flow diagrams
   - API usage examples
   - Updated README with full instructions

3. **Golden Files**
   - Expand beyond risk assessment
   - Cover all 82 schema fields
   - Edge cases and error scenarios

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] 80% code coverage achieved
- [ ] All golden file tests pass
- [ ] Load tests show acceptable performance
- [ ] Red-team eval shows no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Architecture diagrams complete
- [ ] API documentation complete
