  "note_content": "Patient presents as unusually calm and reports 'everything is fine now.' This is notable change from last session when patient was in acute distress with passive SI. Patient has given away several personal items to friends this week, including favorite watch to brother. When asked directly about suicidal thoughts, patient smiled and stated 'I'm at peace, don't worry about me.' Denies any plans. Given gift-giving behavior, sudden resolution following acute distress, and incongruent affect, clinician assesses likely continued passive SI with possible concealment. Increased monitoring and collateral contact recommended.",
