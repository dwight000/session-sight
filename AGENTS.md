# SessionSight Agent Instructions

## Session Bootstrap (Read First)
- Read `/home/dwight/CLAUDE.md`.
- Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- Read `plan/docs/BACKLOG.md`.

## Working Preferences
- Do not create commits or push unless the user explicitly asks.

## MCP Usage
- Check MCP availability at session start (`list_mcp_resources`, `list_mcp_resource_templates`).
- If Playwright MCP is available, use it for browser-based verification and UI debugging.
- If MCP is unavailable, continue with shell/test-based workflows.
